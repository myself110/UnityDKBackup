5) save the package to whatever directory you want, and that's it ! You can now send this file.

## Import a Scene
1) once you have downloaded the package, go to the location where you want your scene to be imported (like Assets/Scenes)
2) right click, select "Import package" -> "Custom package", select the package file
3) Unity should automatically select the missing dependancies
